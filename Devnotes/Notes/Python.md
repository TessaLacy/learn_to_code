- In all programmin languages, variables cannot contain any embedded cpaces
- Python is considered an interpreted language, an it's possible to write a compiler for it. But Python is different from compiled languages like C and C++ because Python code doesn't need to be built and linked
**Program** a sequence of computer language statements that have been crafted to do something. It consists of lines of codes the computer runs and uses variables to perform them. Things must run in a specific order.
- There are three main operations executed in a program 1. **Input** to the program allows data to be entered in through a variety of ways like keyboard, mouse, file, other devices, images, sound. Input is stored into the memory and includes all types of data, like text and numeric values. 2. **Processing** data includes storing, using for calculations, validating, and sorting. 3. **Output** after processing, is sent to the monitor, printer, email, file, report, or anything we can see the resulting data.
- So input raw data, process it into useful info and then output it to the user.
**Syntax** is grammer rules of a programming language. Each programming language has it's own syntax and computers can't understand a program if the syntax is incorrect.
**Compiler** scans an entire program, aka readable code and attempts to convert the whole program at once to machine code or computer readable code. A compiled program has limitations because it can only be run on the specicic platforms it was written for.
**Machine code** aka machine language, uses binary (0&1) to perform tasks, Programming language code gets compiled to machine code.
