- watched a video on Github and am trying to give myself a good base from the very beginning of my coding journey that will allow me to stay organized, take good notes, and document my fuull journey in GitHub
- I watched the HTML and CSS tutorial from Smoljames on YT. where I re-created the Google page as it looks today. It was a great way to get to know HTML and CSS. It was easy to understand and follow along. I did not feel overwhelmed or lost, which was a fear of mine. So far, so good. His tutorials are very thourough.
